# This file is named z_dsl to take advantage of Chef's method of loading library
# files. By loading this file last, the rest of the required libraries will
# have already been loaded removing the need to require them each individually.

# By including this file, the DSL exposed by DeliverySugar will be made available
# in your Chef Recipes, Resources and Providers.

# In general, the way we are doing this (using .send) is a bad idea because in
# other places easily cause naming collisions. However, because delivery-sugar
# is only intended to run inside Delivery Phase Runs, the risk of method naming
# collissions is lessened.
